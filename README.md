iOS and LightBlue Bean code to make a servo based 2 wheel robot

Required Things
---------------
iOS device
LightBlue Bean from Punch Through Design - http://www.punchthrough.com
2 continuous rotation servos
2 servo horns
2 nice big wheels, mine are from an RC car
Power source for the servo's - I used a standard RC receiver battery box
A bit of glue
Some wires.  The standard Arduino ones are good as they push right into the servo connectors
Sticky velcro

Source Code
-----------
The code is pretty self explanatory, just fire it up and run.  The iOS code will automatically scan for a Bean and connect.  Once connected just touch the screen to control the 2 wheels.

Construction
------
This is a nice project to make with your kids.  No soldering, simple wiring, and pleasing results :)

Velcro the base of the servo's together, make sure the drive cogs are parallel.  Glue your servo horns to your wheels.  Attach wheels to servos.  Velcro battery box to servo's.  Velcro Bean to other side.

Wiring
------
The servo + (red wires) go to battery +
The servo - (brown or black) go to battery - and also Bean Gnd
The servo signal (yellow or orange) go to Bean pins 2 and 3.  Pin 2 is left servo, pin 3 is right servo.
